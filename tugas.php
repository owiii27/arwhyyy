                    <li>The Nike LeBron 22 continues to try and build on <br>
                        the performance of the previous two models but takes a slight step back in one regard.</li>
                    <li>Traction performance remains top-tier. Most reviewers agree the outsole <br>
                        grips well and feels safe, especially on cleaner courts.</li>
                    <li>The cushioning is outstanding for impact protection and bounciness. <br>
                        The midsole also feels responsive, which is a plus.</li>
                    <li>Materials are where the shoe regresses. The upper is comfortable and supportive, <br>
                        but the shoe feels heavier than the previous models.</li>
                    <li>The fit is accommodating, thanks to the spacious forefoot.</li>
                    <li>For support and lockdown, Nike implements a unique midfoot saddle to help with stability <br>
                        and torsional support. Your foot also feels secure during lateral movements.</li>
                    <li>LeBron's latest signature shoe maintains impressive performance, <br>
                        highlighted mainly by the traction and cushioning. </li>
